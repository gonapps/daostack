# About the docs

The docs website is powered by [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).
It pulls `.md` files from under `docs/` and displays them in a nice looking way.

## Commands

* `yarn run docs:serve` - open a dev server to view the docs locally at `http://localhost:3000`

## Contributing

Simply add new `.md` files in `docs` folder.
