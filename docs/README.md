# DAOStack Docs

Welcome to DAOStack Docs!
DAOStack is an operating system for DAOs built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is a DAO?

[Decentrelized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) are living breathing entities that manage resources and make desicions on the blockchain based on a predefined set of rules expressed as a computer program. Running on the blockchain guarentees that they follow the defined rules exactly, and without a trusted party to manage it's execution.

## Why DAOStack?

Building and maintating DAOs on the blockchain is tricky and error-prone. 
DAOStack provides a set of simple well-tested, generic and flexible primitives that can be used to implement pretty much any DAO!
Using DAOStack lets you focus on building your DAO instead of re-inventing the wheel, managing migrations and worrying about security vulnrabilities.
